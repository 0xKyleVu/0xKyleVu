# Hi there, I'm Quan (Kyle) 👋
### 🎓 Master of Data Science Grad @ Swinburne University

I focus on Data Analytics and Engineering, finding insights in the numbers and building the pipelines to move data around.

Currently, I'm bridging the gap between raw on-chain data and business insights. This profile is where I'll be uploading my ETL projects, Python scripts, and SQL experiments.
